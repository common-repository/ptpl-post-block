PTPL post block is plugin that blocks your post content, and unlock it, when visitor like your link on social networks or wait any time what you want. 

== Description ==


**"PTPL Post Block" is first multi post blocking plugin.**

"PTPL Post Block"  allows you to block the content of each post separately.
**The big plus of the plugin** is that you can use the same link to like for all posts, or you can specify separate links for each post.
**Another plus** is that an individual link for liking can be added to post directly from edit page of post.
It's very easy in use. You can switch on/off the plugin from the settings by a checkbox.
Currently plugin supports liking post, page or something else on the **"Facebook"** and on the **"Google plus"**.
We are planning to add support for other social networks such as "LinkedIn", "Twitter" and others.
Also we're planning to add customisations, such as changing styles.
